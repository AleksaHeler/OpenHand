# ProstheticHand
 
Our attempt at a prosthetic hand controlled by muscle EMG sensors, using linear actuators to move mechanically linked fingers. Implementing our own 3D models (ME), schematic & PCB design of main control board (EE) and software solution (SW).


## Proof of concept

For (very basic and quick) proof of concept, we measure bicep activation because it seemed the simplest muscle to use. Using the EMG sensor we could get some useful waveforms and filter them with both HW and SW low-pass filter. Also we made some simple 3D printed fingers and connected them with wire to servo motor, and the hand could actually move and be controlled using muscle activation.

Some images of the POC:

See a video of the hand being operated by a potentiometer [here](images/poc/poc_finger_test.mp4).

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) defition

Here are the pictures of the whiteboard and an example hand we had in mind for first MVP (TODO: document this process and finalize plan):

## Examples/demos of ME/EE/SW

TODO: describe all three parts of the project roughly here, add some images/diagrams of high level overview
